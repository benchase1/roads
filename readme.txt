This is an application to display and locate road junctions.

HOW TO NAVIGATE THE DATABASE:
After downloading, go to the command line and type java state (replace with two letter state abbreviation). From there, enter the route number with a state prefix. For example, Massachusetts Route 9 would be "ma9", US 1 would be "us1", and I-90 would be "i90". All are case sensitive.

In the event of multiple instances, such as US 1A in Maine, input the above code, add a hyphen, and the name of the town where the southern or western terminus of the route is. For example, US 1A in York, Maine would be "us1a-york". Names are case sensitive, and town names are all lowercase, with a hyphen for a space. East Longmeadow, Massachusetts would be "east-longmeadow". The Massachusetts Department of Transportation defines the two segments of Massachusetts Route 8A to be 8A-L and 8A-U. These names are used in the application, and their codes are "ma8a-l", and "ma8a-u". Multiple sections of a suffixed route, such as Massachusetts Route 1A, are stored in the database as the road name, followed by the place with the southern or western terminus of the section. For example, the section of Massachusetts Route 1A starting in Attleboro, is in as "ma1a-attleboro". (Note: These will be fully incorporated by the end of August 2020.) Suffixed routes with only one section, or one whole route not split by the parent, do not have this addition.

Routes included in this database are from Travel Mapping (travelmapping.net), however, I have the right to add or remove routes if they fit or don't fit the use of this database.

Additional names such as business or bypass are not hyphenated. For example, I-90 business would be "i90bus". US 6 bypass would be "us6byp". Names such as "toll", "loop", or "spur" are not added.

Exception to the above: Texas Spur and Loop Routes are added, and will be in the Texas file with names like "spur1" or "loop1". Other Texas routes added would be Farm / Ranch to Market ("farm1", ranch not used), Park ("park"), Recreation ("rec"), and Ranch Road 1 ("ranch1").
