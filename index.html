<title>Roads Database</title>

<p>This is a database of road junctions.</p>

<h4>How to Navigate This Database</h4>
<p>After downloading, go to the command line and type java <state> (replace with two letter state abbreviation). From there, enter the route number with a state prefix. For example, Massachusetts Route 9 would be "ma9", US 1 would be "us1", and I-90 would be "i90". All are case sensitive.</p>
  
<p>In the event of multiple instances, such as US 1A in Maine, input the above code, add a hyphen, and the name of the town where the southern or western terminus of the route is. For example, US 1A in York, Maine would be "us1a-york". Names are case sensitive, and town names are all lowercase, with a hyphen for a space. East Longmeadow, Massachusetts would be "east-longmeadow".</p>

<p>Additional names such as business or bypass are not hyphenated. For example, I-90 business would be "i90bus". US 6 bypass would be "us6byp". Names such as "toll", "loop", or "spur" are not added.</p>

<p>Exception to the above: Texas Spur and Loop Routes are added, and will be in the Texas file with names like "spur1" or "loop1". Other Texas routes added would be Farm / Ranch to Market ("farm1", ranch not used), Park ("park"), Recreation ("rec"), and Ranch Road 1 ("ranch1"). </p>
