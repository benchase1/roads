# roads
This is an under construction application to display and locate road junctions.

## Progress Stages
There are three stages in the progress of a region or road.

#### Development
This is the first stage of a region or road being added. At this point, the road or region has not been added to the application.

#### Preview
The preview stage is when the road or region is added to all beta releases of the application. A road or region enters preview status when all junctions have been added.

#### Full
The full stage is when all bugs and issues have been fixed on a road or region. At this point, the road or region is added to the full release of the application. The road or region will continue to stay on all beta releases as well.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project! To contribute, you must be familiar with programming in Java. Currently, only roads within the United States and Canada will be added.
